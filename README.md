# ZoomCount
Unfortunately, I learned from deploying this app that PyAutoGui does not work on a web app, since it runs on the server.  
However, for those still interested in trying this app out, it runs fine on a localhost.  
Also, the feature I would like to use from Zoom's API required a business level account, which cannot be guaranteed for any given user.  

Thus, this project has met it's demise for the foreseeable future.
