# ZoomCount
Unfortunately, I learned from deploying this app that PyAutoGui does not work on a web app, since it runs on the server.  
However, for those still interested in trying this app out (and with VSCode), the app should work fine on the localhost.
Also, the feature I would have hoped to use from Zoom's API required a business level account, which cannot be guaranteed for any given user.  

So it is with a heavy heart that I declare this project has met it's demise for the foreseeable future.
